#data-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hshiraiwa/data-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hshiraiwa/data-stream)

A Promise like data-stream implementation.

##Installing
* npm:

        $ npm install --save data-stream

* bower

        $ bower install --save data-stream


##Documentation

    const Stream = require('data-stream')
    const s = new Stream()

###Stream Class

The Stream Class is responsible to receive the data from the broadcaster 

####Methods
* notify(data: any) : None
> Send information to this and all child streams

* then(callback: Function) : Stream
> Generates a child stream that applies a extra callback

* map(callback: Function) : Stream
> Just like then, but applies the callback to each element of the data instead of to the data itself

### Examples:

#### Setting up streams:

	const Stream = require('data-stream');
	const s = new Stream();
	let stream1 = s.then(() => console.log("stream 1 exec 1"))
			.then(() => console.log("stream 1 exec 2"))
			.then(() => console.log("stream 1 exec 3"));
	let stream2 = s.then(() => console.log("stream 2 exec 1"))
			.then(() => console.log("stream 2 exec 2"))
			.then(() => console.log("stream 2 exec 3"));
	s.notify();
	//stream 1 exec 1
	//stream 1 exec 2
	//stream 1 exec 3
	//stream 2 exec 1
	//stream 2 exec 2
	//stream 2 exec 3

#### Transforming data:

	const Broadcaster = require('data-stream');
	const s = new Stream();
	s.map((el) => el+1)
			.then(data => console.log(data));
	s.notify([1,2,3]);
	//[2,3,4]

##Why ?
this package was built to easily manage asynchronous data between a service and several controllers on angular.
